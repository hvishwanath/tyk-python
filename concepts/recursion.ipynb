    "## 9. Pros and Cons of Recursion - When to Use It, When Not To 🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a cool tool, but like any tool, it's not always the *best* tool for every job. Let's think about the pros and cons of using recursion:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros of Recursion:** 👍\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Elegance and Readability (for certain problems):** For some problems, recursion can make the code very concise and easier to understand compared to other ways of solving it.  Especially for problems that are naturally recursive in their structure (like tree-like structures, or problems that can be easily broken down into smaller, self-similar pieces).\n",
    "*   **Natural Fit for Recursive Problems:** Recursion is a very natural way to solve problems that are defined in a recursive way (like the Fibonacci sequence, or traversing a folder structure on your computer).\n",
    "*   **Divide and Conquer:** Recursion is often used in \"divide and conquer\" algorithms, where you break a problem into smaller subproblems, solve them recursively, and then combine the solutions to solve the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons of Recursion:** 👎\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Potential for Stack Overflow:** As we learned, if you're not careful with your base case, you can get Stack Overflow errors, especially for very deep recursion (many recursive calls).\n",
    "*   **Performance Overhead (sometimes):**  Function calls in programming take a little bit of time.  Recursive functions involve many function calls, so sometimes recursive solutions can be a bit slower than solutions using loops (iteration). However, in Python, the performance difference is often not huge, and Python is pretty good at handling recursion.  For some problems, the recursive solution might even be optimized by Python to be just as fast as an iterative one!\n",
    "*   **Can be harder to debug and trace (initially):**  Understanding the flow of recursive calls can be a little trickier at first compared to loops.  You need to think about the call stack and how the function calls unfold and unwind.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Recursion?** ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "*   When the problem is naturally recursive (like tree traversals, fractals, recursive mathematical definitions).\n",
    "*   When recursion makes the code significantly simpler and more readable compared to an iterative (loop-based) solution.\n",
    "*   When you are confident you can design a correct base case and recursive step to avoid Stack Overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When NOT to Use Recursion (and maybe use loops instead)?** ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "*   For very simple iterations where a loop might be clearer and more efficient.\n",
    "*   If performance is extremely critical and stack overflow is a major concern (though in many cases, you can still use recursion in Python without significant performance issues).\n",
    "*   If the problem doesn't have a natural recursive structure, and forcing a recursive solution makes the code more complicated than necessary.\n",
    "\n",

    "# 🎉 Exercises! Time to Practice Your Recursion Superpower! 🎉\n",

    "\n",
    "Try these exercises to practice writing recursive functions. Don't worry if you find them a bit challenging at first – recursion takes practice!  Read the hints carefully, and remember the two magic ingredients: **Base Case** and **Recursive Step!** ✨\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start Simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Sum of Numbers (Recursive):**\n",
    "   Write a recursive function `recursive_sum(n)` that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` (e.g., `recursive_sum(5)` should be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15).\n",
    "   *(Hint: Base case: when `n` is 1, the sum is just 1. Recursive step: the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` is `n` plus the sum of numbers from 1 to `n-1`.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. String Reversal (Recursive):**\n",
    "   Write a recursive function `reverse_string(s)` that reverses a string (e.g., `reverse_string(\"hello\")` should return \"olleh\").\n",
    "   *(Hint: Base case: if the string is empty, the reversed string is also empty. Recursive step: reverse the rest of the string (all characters except the first one) and then add the first character to the *end* of the reversed rest.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slightly More Challenging:\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Power Function (Recursive):**\n",
    "   Write a recursive function `power(base, exponent)` that calculates `base` raised to the power of `exponent` (e.g., `power(2, 3)` should be 8).\n",
    "   *(Hint: Base case: if the exponent is 0, the result is always 1. If the exponent is 1, the result is just the base. Recursive step: `base` raised to the power of `exponent` is `base` times `base` raised to the power of `exponent - 1`.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Check Palindrome (Recursive):**\n",
    "   Write a recursive function `is_palindrome(word)` that checks if a word is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards, e.g., \"madam\" is a palindrome).\n",
    "   *(Hint: Base case: an empty string or a string of length 1 is always a palindrome. Recursive step: check if the first and last characters of the word are the same. If they are, then recursively check if the rest of the word (excluding the first and last characters) is also a palindrome.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus - Thinking about Recursion vs. Iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Factorial (Iterative):**\n",
    "   We already wrote a recursive `factorial` function. Now, rewrite the `factorial` function using a loop (iterative approach) instead of recursion. We actually did this example earlier in the notebook! Compare the iterative and recursive versions in terms of readability (which one do you find easier to understand?) and (conceptually) performance (which one might be slightly faster or slower, and why?).\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. When to Use Recursion? Scenario:**\n",
    "   Imagine you are writing a program to explore all the folders and subfolders on your computer, starting from your main \"Documents\" folder.  Explain why recursion might be a good approach for this problem. What would be the base case in this scenario? What would be the recursive step? (Think about how folders can contain other folders inside them!).\n",
