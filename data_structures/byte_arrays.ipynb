       "\n",
       "You already know about `bytes`, right?  `bytes` are like secret codes for computers. They represent data in binary form (0s and 1s), which is how computers understand everything.  But `bytes` are **immutable**, which means once you create them, you can't change them. It's like writing a secret code on paper with a pen - once it's written, you can't erase or change it directly (without making a mess!).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Motivation:** But what if you *need* to change your secret code? What if you need to update a data packet in your game? That's where `bytearray` comes in! We need a way to **modify** binary data directly. \n",
       "\n",
       "**Analogy:** Think of `bytearray` as a **digital secret code**! 💻 Unlike `bytes` which are like written codes, `bytearray` is like a secret code you can edit on your computer screen. You can rewrite parts of it, add to it, or take away from it.  It's still a sequence of bytes, but now you have **editing superpowers**! 💪\n",
       "\n",
       "**Explanation:**  A Python `bytearray` is a **mutable sequence of single bytes**.  \"Mutable\" means **changeable**.  Each byte in a `bytearray` is represented by an integer from **0 to 255**.  It's very similar to `bytes`, but the HUGE difference is that `bytearray` **can be modified** after you create it. \n",
